# GANs

### Architecture of Basic GAN:

A generative adversarial network (GAN) has two parts:

The **generator** learns to generate plausible data. The generated instances become negative training examples for the discriminator.

The **discriminator** learns to distinguish the generator's fake data from real data. The discriminator penalizes the generator for producing implausible results.
